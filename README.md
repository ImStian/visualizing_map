# Visualizing geodata using Python
This repository uses the "seacharts"-library for Python to visualize geodata in the .gdb fileformat.

As of now it is very basic and covers the example-code found on the Github page for the package itself.

Place the geodata file (.gdb) in the root of this repository.
